# Continuous control

## Introduction

Continuous control is the second project of a Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program. 
For this project, an agent will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/ChalamPVS/Unity-Reacher) environment. 
In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations and its goal is to maintain its position
at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

This README file is very short as there are some problems with learning, and environment was not solved. The project
is not done and after successful learning of the agent, this will be changed.


## Getting Started

- **Step 1** - Set up your Python environment
        Python 3.6 was used in the project
        type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in command line to install requirements
- **Step 2** - Build the Unity Environment
        Download the environment using this [link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        Unzip `Reacher_Linux.zip` environment and copy it to the main folder of the project.
        Note that provided environment will work only on Linux based machines!
- **Step 3** - Check `main.py` and familiarize yourself with arguments and hyper-parameters.
